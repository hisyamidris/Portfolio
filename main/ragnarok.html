					<h3>Introduction to Ragnarok Online</h3>
                    <p>Ragnarok Online is a Korean massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) created by GRAVITY Co., Ltd. based on manhwa Ragnarok by Lee Myung-jin. Ragnarok Online is divided into a series of maps on two major continents, each of which has its own terrain and native monsters, through many monsters are present in multiple region. Transportation between maps requires loading the new map and monsters are unavailable to travel from one map to another.</p>
                    <p>"Jobs" are one of the most important aspect of Ragnarok Online. A player choice of job will determine his or her strengths and weaknesses both in a party or outside of one. The job system initually consisted of 13 classes, which has increased to over 50 via several updates. Each class specializes in certain skills corresponding to archetypes in a role-playing game. Additioanlly, numerous equipment are exclusive to particular classes. The greatness of the equipment depends on the character attribute status.</p>
                    <h3>Skill Tweaks and Reworks</h3>
                    <p>One of my biggest accomplishments (also the most challenging) on Ragnarok private server game design is to expand the pool of viable skill builds while maintaining the usability of the original builds.
					Apart from doing calculations and creating balance sheet, I usually use the following principles when designing/tweaking skills:			
				  <ul>
					<li><b>Fun to use:</b> A new skill or mechanic for a character should go beyond just filling in the skill tree or be just another better version of previous skill. They should make the game dynamic fun! </li>
					<li><b>Meaningful choice:</b> Like any games with choices, sooner or later, players will be pinning down to a few common builds known to be the best. But it is important to make sure that other "uncommon" skills should have its use in the game. This is especially important to keep your game competitive by adding another layer of depth that separates good players from great players.</li>
					<li><b>Fit in with the class/character:</b> This is actually a simple principle but surprisingly missing in some games I've played or redesigned. An assassin should make use of stealth or distraction abilities and not charge into the frontlines like a warrior. </li>
					<li><b>Fun to play against:</b> Any skill designed in a multiplayer game should be exciting on the player it is used on as well. A skill should introduce a FUN counterplay for the opposing team. It should create more interesting option for both the players using and and playing against it.</li>
					<li><b>Understanding when to tweak a skill:</b> When releasing a new skill, build or class it is natural that it would be seen as either too strong or too weak by your players. But it is also important to know when you should change it, sometimes the build is not obvious to your players and it will take time for them to understand how to play or fight against a new build. This is where listening skill comes into play, you need to understand what is actually the problem instead of introducing a new patch every week. The feedback section in your forums is there for a reason right?</li>
                  </ul><!-- end post-meta --></p>
                    <h3>Other changes</h3>
                    <p>I've been working on Ragnarok online for more than 8 years (still revisit from time to time), I don't think it is possible to list down all the changes and new concepts that I've designed for this game in detail. To keep it short, I've designed storylines, new classes, new skills, new maps and even a new genre (which I am really excited about to share)! Been designing a game this long, there's a lot that I've learned about game design and development. I'd definitely write more but time is off the essense. If you're interested to know more, I'm more than happy to share it with you in-person or via skype. Feel free to shoot me an email or message me on linkedin or twitter. :)</p>
